# home-medication-management

The website designed to help you manage the medicines you have at home, control their use or disposal. Thanks to this solution you are able to see how many and what kind of medicines are left in your 'medicine cabinet', get to know the expiration dates of medicines. As one medicine cabinet can be shared with several people such as family members, it is also possible to see the history of operations with details of each participant. 

The project was made as a part of a university course credit in cooperation with ..., therefore the code is in Polish. You can see how the completed project looks like under the [link](https://student.agh.edu.pl/~izawilus/apteka/start.php).
